Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Client: Artemis Financial, a fintech company specializing in secure online transactions and investment management.
Issue: The company identified security vulnerabilities in its financial application, including weak authentication mechanisms, outdated encryption protocols, and potential data exposure risks. They required a secure, compliant, and resilient software solution to protect client data and ensure regulatory adherence.

Enforced AES-256 encryption for secure data storage and to ensure that data remains confidential. Patched security flaws by updating outdated dependencies and removing deprecated code to improve code quality, eliminate redundant code, and streamline the system.

I expirence a lot of challenges, but two of the most common are determining if something is an actual threat or a false alarm (distinguishing false positives from actual vulnerabilities) and putting security patches into effect without doing damage to the way the application runs (implementing security patches without breaking application functionality).

Network security is important in all aspects of life. Here are a few important topics. First is firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Secondly, application security can be established by implementing secure authentication, input validation, and encryption. Finally, endpoint security is ensured with regular security patching and monitoring.

Tools Used: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, Burp Suite, Postman, Jest for testing.
Coding Best Practices: SOLID principles, least privilege access, secure coding guidelines.
Future Employer Showcases:

Before & after security audit reports demonstrating vulnerability mitigation.
Refactored secure code samples showcasing best practices.
Security testing documentation proving compliance and proactive security efforts.
